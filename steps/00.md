I want to show you step-by-step how to write the devfile for the project. We'll try to run the devfile and do few changes in the project to see it in action.
I'll use the RealWorld demo application. I'll start with spring boot java backend and javascript react frontend. Then I'll try to connect backend into mysql database.


  - devfile from scratch
  - RealWorld demo app (https://github.com/gothinkster/realworld)
    - Java spring boot backend
    - Javascript on react frontend
    - + MySQL database
