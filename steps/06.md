Second component will be for the frontend and I'll define it as Kubernetes component. We can have also Openshift component, that will look the same, but might have different content. We want again mount sources into it. In `referenceContent`, we'll define our kubernetes object which will be one Pod. In reality it won't be pod, it will be sidecar container in the workspace pod.
We don't define any endpoint here. It will be later "generated" for us.
Ok, we have our components.

### components - frontend
  - `kubernetes` type, mount sources
  - define simple `Pod` with one container
  - can define service/ingress, but it will be handled automatically
