Now to the components. There are basically 2 types, plugins for Che itself and custom components for the application.
First we have `cheEditor` and `chePlugin`s. These are defined in `che-plugin-registry` (https://github.com/eclipse/che-plugin-registry).
Currently only suitable option for `cheEditor` is Theia. We have our fork `che-theia`. This is implicit option so I don't have to define it, but I'll write it here to be more explicit. `id` is reference in `che-plugin-registry`.
Plugins are defined with `chePlugin` type. We will use java and javascript languages so we'll add 2 plugins to support these languages. They are using language servers so they get us features like code completion, code navigation, code syntax check, documentation, etc. We'll also define `memoryLimit` for them.
