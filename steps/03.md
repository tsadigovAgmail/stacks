`attributes` are various attributes for the workspace. It does not have any structure, just key-value pairs.
We define `persistVolumes:false` here. That means that everything we do in the workspace won't be persisted and will be destroyed with the workspace. When we will start the workspace again, it will be clean. We need that for 2 reasons. First is that build might be faster. Second that che.openshift.io, where we will run the devfile, has filecount limitations and with nodejs build, that downloads half of the internet, it's easily exceeded.


### attributes
  - key-value pairs
  - `persistVolume = false` - changes will be lost after workspace stop
    - faster
    - file limits on che.openshift.io
