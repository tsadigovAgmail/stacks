Now let's define our own components. We have 2 options here. We can define either `dockerimage` component, which has structure defined in the devfile. Or we can go with `kubernetes`/`openshift` component, which is defined as plain k8s yaml.
First for java backend. We'll define it as a `dockerimage` component. Here, we need to define docker image we want to use. Again define `memoryLimit` and we want to mount the sources into the container. We'll also define endpoint for backend REST API. It will be public so it can be reached by the frontend.


### components - backend
  - 2 options `dockerimage` and `kubernetes`/`openshift`
  - `dockerimage` for `java-backend`
  - `mountSources` - projects in `/projects/<project_name>`
  - `endpoint` for port where application run and make it public
    - `public` - accessible outside of the workspace -> ingress created
