Now we can define the projects. Project is basically source code repository that will be cloned into our workspace. We have 2 of them - java backend and react frontend.
`name` will be used as folder name in home directory where the repository will be cloned. If we want to change clone path, we can define `clonePath` parameter. But we don't need it here.


### projects
  - source-code repositories
  - backend & frontend repository
  - `name` is folder
  - `type`, `branch`, `clonePath`
